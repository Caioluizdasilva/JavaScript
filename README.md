# JavaScript Basics Project

## Description

This repository was created as part of my journey to review and reinforce core JavaScript concepts. The idea behind this project is to revisit the foundations of JavaScript in a practical and organized way, including small examples and exercises that cover the language basics and how it interacts with the browser.
